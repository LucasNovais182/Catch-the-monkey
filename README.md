# Catch-the-monkey 🐒 
Minigame idealized for me while I was creating a sliding ad. The object of the game is to catch the crazy monkey that appears randomly on the screen.

## Starting
There is no need to install anything, as this game was created with HTML, CSS and pure JS. You can access the [game link](https://lucasnovais182.github.io/Catch-the-monkey/) and have fun or download the zip and run it on your machine and, if you want / can,
to contribute to this repository 😍.
